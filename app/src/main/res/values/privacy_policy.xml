<p>Your privacy is important to us and we will only process your personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy and relevant personal data regulation.</p>
<h3 id="h.3x629b85kevl">Data processing necessary to provide the Services</h3>

<p>As you continue to use the Services, you will regularly provide Fiasy with further personal data. It follows from the nature of the Services that we must process such data that you upload to the Services to enable the Services, for example, we will process your weight data and calorie intake to enable the monitoring and presentation of your personal goals (whether it be weight loss or weight gain). This processing is a pre-requisite for us being able to offer the Services to you.</p>

<p>Some of the data mentioned above, collected from you and processed by Fiasy for certain features of the Services, is possible for us to delete and cease processing for the future if you so require, without you having to terminate your use of the entire Services, i.e., not all data (submitted over time by you to us either directly or through third-party services) is required for you to still be able to use the Services. If you want us to cease processing certain data about you under this category, we will inform about the consequences of such cease, i.e., how it will affect your use of the features of the Services.</p>
<h3 id="h.3sd2tq82x4tl">Customer relationship as a legal ground</h3>
<p>It should be noted that marketing sent by Fiasy to you on the basis of a customer relationship as a legal ground for processing personal data, does not require a consent. Such data will be processed and used in compliance with relevant personal data regulation.</p>
<h3 id="h.8210ano2qdd5">Profiling</h3>
<p>Fiasy&rsquo;s Services are based on a profound knowledge of best practice with regard to health.

In addition, Fiasy analyze the usage of the Services, in order to provide you as a user with the most relevant features of the Services as possible with regard to your personal goals. In analyzing the usage of the Services, Fiasy will process certain data for so-called profiling. Profiling means processing of your and other users&rsquo; personal data to analyze or predict aspects of your use of the Services, behavior and, location in reaching your health goal. The data processed will be user habits where we will track actions taken by you such as when you move between screens, press buttons and take actions on the Services. The purposes of the profiling is to monitor how engaged users are in different features of our Services, find out ways to make the Service more effective (fit for purpose) and vary the features or content to better match your individual usage patterns and preferences.</p>
<p>The profiling of your data can also be used as the basis for marketing towards other new potential customers on other platforms than the Fiasy Services, such as other social media platforms. Please note that this so called look-a-like-process of recruiting new customers does not mean that you will receive any marketing. Nor does it mean that any other third parties will gain access to your data for any other purpose than for Fiasy to reach new customers, i.e. third party providers (for example social media) will only process your data on behalf of Fiasy as processors, see further under transfer of data below.</p>
<p>Fiasy&rsquo;s processing of your personal data for profiling purposes as described above, does not require any consent as a legal ground to be processed. If this should be the case, i.e. if, under relevant personal data regulation, consent is required for the use as described above, you hereby give your consent to Fiasy using your personal data as defined above for profiling, for the purpose of improving the Services and for providing customer support.</p>
